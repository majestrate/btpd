.SH "STAT OPTIONS"
.TP

.SH "START OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Activate all non\-active torrents.
.SH "STOP OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Deactivate all torrents.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
toxn must be started before txcli can be used.  See \fBtoxn\fR(1) for help with starting toxn.
.PP
To start sharing a torrent with toxn, the torrent needs to be added to toxn. This is done with \fBtxcli add\fR. Unless otherwise specified, toxn automatically starts to share the torrent and download any missing data. If the content directory you specify when adding a torrent does not exist, toxn will create it.
.PP
You can see which torrents have been added to toxn with \fBtxcli list\fR.  The list mode also displays a number for each added torrent. This number can be used to specify the target torrent for the txcli modes, so you don't have to keep the torrent file after adding it.
.PP
The up\- and download progress can be followed by using the \fBtxcli stat\fR mode. Both the list and stat modes use the following indicators to display the state of a torrent:
.RS 4
.TP 4
\fB+\fR
The torrent is starting. This may take time if toxn needs to test the content of this torrent or one started before it.
.TP 4
\fB\-\fR
The torrent is being stopped.
.TP 4
\fBI\fR
The torrent is inactive.
.TP 4
\fBS\fR
toxn is seeding the torrent.
.TP 4
\fBL\fR
toxn is leeching the torrent.
.RE
.PP
You can stop an active torrent with \fBtxcli stop\fR.  You can start an inactive torrent by using \fBtxcli start\fR.
.PP
.B Note:
Torrents can be specified either with its number or its file.
.PP
The \fBtxcli del\fR mode should only be used when you're totally finished with sharing a torrent. The mode will remove the torrent and its associated data from toxn. It is a bad idea to remove a not fully downloaded torrent and then add it again, since toxn has lost information on the not fully downloaded pieces and will need to download the data again.
.PP
To shut down toxn use \fBtxcli kill\fR.
