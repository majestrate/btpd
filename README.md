## Introduction

### What is toxn?

`toxn` is a utility for sharing files over the BitTorrent network protocol.
It runs in daemon mode, thus needing no controlling terminal or gui.
Instead, the daemon is controlled by txcli, its command line utility,
or other programs capable of sending commands and queries on the control
socket.

### The programs

`toxn` consists of the following programs:
* `toxn`     - The bittorrent client.
* `txcli`    - Command line interface to toxn.
* `txinfo`   - Shows information from a torrent file.

All programs accept the `--help` option.

### The txcli commands

The `txcli` utility has several different modes of operation. One of the following commands must be specified when running `txcli`:
* `add`      - Add torrents to toxn.
* `del`      - Remove torrents from toxn.
* `kill`     - Shut down toxn.
* `list`     - List torrents.
* `rate`     - Set the global up and download rates in KB/s.
* `start`    - Activate torrents.
* `stat`     - Display stats for active torrents.
* `stop`     - Deactivate torrents.

## Using toxn

### First

To start sharing a torrent with toxn, the torrent needs to be added to
toxn. This is done with `txcli add`. When you add a torrent toxn automatically (if you didn't specify otherwise) starts to share the torrent
and download any missing data. The content directory you specify when
adding a torrent doesn't need to exist; it will be created by toxn.

You can see which torrents have been added to toxn with `txcli list`.
The list command also displays a number for each added torrent. This number
can be used to specify the target torrent for the txcli commands, so you
don't have to keep the torrent file once you've added it.

The up- and download progress can be followed by using the `txcli stat`
command. Both the list and stat commands use the following indicators to
display the state of a torrent:

* `+`     - the torrent is starting. This may take time if toxn needs to test the content of this torrent or one started before it.
* `-`     - the torrent is being stopped.
* `I`     - the torrent is inactive.
* `S`     - toxn is seeding the torrent.
* `L`     - toxn is leeching the torrent.

You can stop an active torrent with `txcli stop` and, of course,
start an inactive torrent by using `txcli start`.

The `txcli del` command should only be used when you're totally finished
with sharing a torrent. The command will remove the torrent and its
associated data from toxn. It's an escpecially bad idea to remove a not
fully downloaded torrent and then adding it again, since toxn has lost
information on the not fully downloaded pieces and will need to download
the data again.

To shut down toxn use `txcli kill`. Don't forget to read the help for each
of txcli's commands.

### Starting toxn

NOTE: You should only need one instance of toxn regardless of how many
torrents you want to share.

To start toxn with default settings you only need to run it. However,
there are many useful options you may want to use. To see a full list
run `toxn --help`. If you didn't specify otherwise,  toxn starts with
the same set of active torrents as it had the last time it was shut down.

btdp will store information and write its log in `$HOME/.toxn`. Therefore
it needs to be able to write there during its execution. You can specify
another directory via the `-d` option or the `$TOXN_HOME` variable.

I recommend specifiying the maximum number of uploads. Bittorrent employs a
tit for tat algorithm, so uploading at good rates allows for downloading.
Try to find a balance between uploads/outgoing bandwidth and the number of
active torrents.

### Examples

Start toxn with all options set to their default values.
```
# toxn
```

Start toxn and make it listen on port 12345, limit outgoing bandwidth to
200kB/s, limit the number of peers to 40 and not start any torrents that
were active the last time toxn was shut down.
```
# toxn -p 12345 --bw-out 200 --max-peers 40 --empty-start
```

Display a list toxn's torrents and their number, size, status, etc.
```
# txcli list
```

Same as above, but only for torrent 12 and my.little.torrent.
```
# txcli list 12 my.little.torrent
```

Same as above but only for active torrents.
```
# txcli list -a
```

Same as above, but print using a custom format
```
# txcli list -a -f "txcli list -f "%n\t%#\t%p%s\t%r\n"
```

Add foo.torrent, with content dir foo.torrent.d, and start it.
```
# txcli add -d foo.torrent.d foo.torrent
```

Same as above without starting it.
```
# txcli add --no-start -d foo.torrent.d foo.torrent
```

Start bar.torrent and torrent number 7.
```
# txcli start bar.torrent 7
```

Stop torrent number 7.
```
# txcli stop 7
```

Stop all active torrents.
```
# txcli stop -a
```

Remove bar.torrent and it's associated information from toxn.
```
# txcli del bar.torrent
```

Display a summary of up/download stats for the active torrents.
```
# txcli stat
```

Display the summary once every five seconds.
```
# txcli stat -w 5
```

Same as above, but also display individual stats for each active torrent.
```
# txcli stat -w 5 -i
```

Set the global upload rate to 20KB/s and download rate to 1MB/s.
```
# txcli rate 20K 1M
```

Shut down toxn.
```
# txcli kill
```

### Troubleshooting

If toxn has shut down for some unknown reason, check the logfile for
possible clues.

## Building

### Requirements

You should have a BSD, Linux or sufficiently similar system.

Make sure you have recent versions of the following software:
* OpenSSL   - Get at http://www.openssl.org/

You also need a c99 compiler. A non antique GCC should do.

To be able to open the manual located in `doc` you need to have `man-pages` installed.

### Standard build

```
# ./configure
# make
# make install
```

See `./configure --help` for available build options if the above fails.

## Additional notes

### Upgrade from old version

The layout of the torrents directory in the toxn directory has changed
since toxn 0.11. Please remove the torrents directory before running
later versions.

### Pre exit mode

If toxn needs to send stop messages to trackers before shutting down,
it will enter the pre exit mode. A toxn process in this mode can safely
be ignored and will not interfere with any new toxn started in the same
directory.

### Using both IPv6 and IPv4

Unfortunately enabling both IPv6 and IPv4 in toxn is less useful than it
should be. The problem is that some sites have trackers for both versions
and it's likely that the IPv6 one, which probably has less peers, will be
used in favour of the IPv4 one.

In order to fix this problem, the IP version options should be changed to
be per torrent, in some future version of toxn.
